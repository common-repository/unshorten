UnShorten urls from services like bit.ly so your readers can see the full link - this is especially useful if you put tweets on your blog!

== Description ==

When you use tweets in your blog, you will probably have loads of shortened urls like me - bit.ly, su.pr is.gd... But your blog readers would probably rather see the real address. Me too. While this feature is integrated in loads of twitter clients, it's not yet in Wordpress. Oh, hold on, now it is! UnShorten will look at any link that has the link text the same as the URL and will try to expand the URL. The hyperlink URL will stay the same but the link text will change to the real, un-shortened link. Neat, hey?!
